### About JobTracker


JobTracker is a simple application to track Job applications.

It is hosted at https://smjobtracker.herokuapp.com/ as of October 2019.

Instructions for use:

*   **New Job** Click on "New Job" to register a new job. This will appear on the main page.

    Add all the relevant information associated with your application and the contact details for the recruiter. Attach the CV/Resume and any covering letter you sent with your application.

    You can edit the stored information the new job by clicking on the **title** for the job on the "Job Dashboard".
*   **Job Status** Jobs have a colour coded status; Active(green), Inactive(orange) and Obsolete/Archived(red) .
*   **Job Dashboard** Shows all jobs, as well as a status summary for all Jobs. The number of "Posts" associated with each job is also displayed.
*   **Job Posts** As your application process proceeds; add Posts for related information; for example emails, notes and additional information (e.g. paste links to online interview or coding questions). A "Post" consists of a textual note and an optional attachment.
*   **Deletion** Once a job is no longer relevant, it is suggested that you edit the status to "Obsolete/Archived" (you may find some notes for example useful for future reference).

    If you choose to delete the job instead (via clicking on the Job **title**), all posts associated with that job will also be deleted, and cannot be recovered.
